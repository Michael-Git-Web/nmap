#Introduction--
The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is one of Nmap's most powerful and flexible features. It allows users to write (and share) simple scripts (using the Lua programming language ) to automate a wide variety of networking tasks. Those scripts are executed in parallel with the speed and efficiency you expect from Nmap.
Repository for NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) development. You will find my scripts (including non-official ones), libraries, resources and other related material from my workshops.
